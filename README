This is a rewrite of my original bot using electron to train the bot. 
I'm adding some basic filtering of spam based on some spammy words.

This is the initial commit so its still very buggy and code still needs cleaned up.
I also haven't written the cron bot part yet, still working on the training.

There likely won't be a dist version of this.  
You will still need access to scripts folder for the cron bot and other files it creates.
Packaging up all this is pointless at this time.
So running it will be npm install and afterwards npm start.


The SMSSpamCollection.txt is from https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT5/blob/master/data/SMSSpamCollection.txt
If you don't want to use this just create a empty file name SMSSpamCollection.txt

Its just a way to jumpstart the training.
